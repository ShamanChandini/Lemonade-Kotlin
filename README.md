# Project: Lemonade App - Starter Code

Made this app for us bring our vision of making digital lemonade to life. (KOTLIN BASICS)

> The goal is to create a simple, interactive mobile app that allows you to juice lemons until you have a glass of lemonade. 
> Consider it a metaphor, or maybe just a fun way to pass the time!

## What you'll need
   A computer with Android Studio installed.

Lemonade is a simple beverage characterized by its lemon flavor.🍋
Click to select a Lemon😋🤤 and then squeeze it and enjoy having your Drink virtually.😂😂

__1. SELECT - in this state the user must select or “pick” a lemon from the lemon tree 

*2. SQUEEZE - in this state the user “squeezes” a lemon until it is juiced😁

*3. DRINK 🍸- in this state, the lemonade is ready to drink🍋

_4. RESTART - in this state the glass of lemonade is empty💛

The app is built around simplicity, and is organized in a single activity.

The different states of the app (whether the user is selecting a lemon, squeezing the lemon, drinking the lemonade, and, 
finally, the empty glass) are represented by something called a state machine. 

This sounds like a fancy theoretical term, but all this means is that the app's state (i.e. which text and image is shown to the user) is determined by a variable that contains the app's state (select, squeeze, etc.).

The app's state is updated, along with any other needed variables, and then the UI is configured (setting the image and text) separately once all the updates have been made.
